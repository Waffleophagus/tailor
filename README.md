<p align="center"><em>Visualize and edit your Tailscale tailnet's access controls.</em></p>


## What is Tailor?

Tailor is a self-hosted visual tool for [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) administrators. It maps out your tailnet as an interactive, explorable graph and lets you edit your ACL policy with validation and a live preview. An MCP server lets AI agents inspect your tailnet and draft policy changes for your review.

- **Visualize your tailnet** — See every device as a live, force-directed graph that updates in real time as devices come and go.
- **Filter and colorize** — Filter by tag, owner, OS, online status, or subnet-router role. Color nodes by status, tag, owner, or OS.
- **Inspect devices and access** — Click any node to see its owner, tags, IPs, OS, and which other devices it can reach (when authenticated with the Cloud API).
- **Edit ACL policies** — Authenticate with a Tailscale API key to fetch your tailnet's HuJSON policy. Edit directly, validate against Tailscale's Cloud API, preview the result on the graph, stage the draft, and save when you are ready.
- **AI agent integration** *(optional)* — Connect compatible agents via the built-in MCP server. Agents can inspect your topology, read embedded ACL reference docs, draft policy changes, evaluate their impact, and stage them for your review.

## How it works

Tailor is a single Go binary with an embedded Svelte frontend and an optional MCP endpoint. It connects to Tailscale in two ways:

1. **LocalAPI** — Reads your local `tailscaled` daemon (via Unix socket or TCP) for the live device list. No credentials required. Or you can give it a Tailscale authentication key and Tailor will become its own node on your tailnet (this is recommended for Docker deployments.)
2. **Cloud API** *(optional)* — With a Tailscale API key, Tailor fetches your tailnet's ACL policy, resolves effective access into graph edges, and enables editing with validation.

The same Go backend serves both the web UI and the MCP endpoint, so agents see the same live topology and policy data you do in the browser.

## Quick start

### Docker (recommended)

Published images are on GitHub Container Registry:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/waffleophagus/tailor:latest
```

The recommended way to run Tailor is with `docker compose`. A reference [`compose.yaml`](compose.yaml) is included in the repo (it uses `build: .` for local builds). For the published image, create a `compose.yaml` like this:

```yaml
services:
  tailor:
    image: ghcr.io/waffleophagus/tailor:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      TAILOR_ADDR: ":8080"
      TAILOR_LOG_DIR: /var/log/tailor
      # Choose one of the two modes below:
```

**Embedded mode** (recommended — container joins your tailnet as its own node):

```yaml
      TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY: "tskey-auth-..."
      # TS_AUTHKEY also works.
      TAILSCALE_HOSTNAME: "tailor"
      # Optional: advertise tags
      # TS_ADVERTISE_TAGS: "tag:tailor-acl-service"
```

Once the node joins your tailnet, Tailor serves HTTPS directly through `tsnet`, so you can open **`https://tailor.<your-tailnet>.ts.net/`** — no `:8080` required. Port `8080` is only needed for local (non-tailnet) access.

**External mode** (use your host's already-running `tailscaled` — Linux only):

```yaml
      TAILOR_TAILSCALE_MODE: "external"
      TAILOR_LOCALAPI_SOCKET: "/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock:/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock:ro
```

Add a log volume for either mode:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./tailor-state:/var/lib/tailor-tsnet
      - ./tailor-logs:/var/log/tailor
```

Then run:

```sh
docker compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Pin a release: `ghcr.io/waffleophagus/tailor:0.1.0` or `ghcr.io/waffleophagus/tailor:v0.1.0`.

### Prebuilt binary

Each [GitHub Release](../../releases) ships production binaries (no dev/demo tags) for Linux, macOS, and Windows, plus a `checksums.txt` file.

```sh
# Example: Linux amd64
curl -LO https://github.com/Waffleophagus/tailor/releases/latest/download/tailor_0.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf tailor_0.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x tailor
./tailor
```

The binary is fully self-contained. By default it listens on `:8080` and reads your local `tailscaled` socket.

### Build from source

Requires [Go](https://go.dev) 1.26+, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 24+, and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

```sh
# Install frontend dependencies and build the UI
pnpm --dir web install
pnpm --dir web build

# Compile the Go binary
go build -o tailor ./cmd/tailor

# Run it
./tailor
```

## AI Agent Integration

Tailor can expose an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server so compatible agents — Claude, Cursor, and others — can inspect and help manage your tailnet.

### What agents can do

- **Inspect topology** — Read your live device list, access edges, and current ACL policy.
- **Draft policy changes** — Agents use embedded Tailscale ACL reference docs to propose safe, syntax-correct HuJSON edits.
- **Evaluate impact** — Before staging, agents preview what would change on the graph: added, removed, and broadened access.
- **Stage for review** — Agents never save directly. Changes are staged inside Tailor for you to review in the UI and decide whether to apply or discard.

### Setup

1. **Enable the MCP server** by setting `TAILOR_MCP`:
   - `localhost` — for agents running on the same machine
   - `tailnet` — for agents anywhere on your tailnet (requires `TAILOR_MCP_TOKEN`)
   - `public` — for agents over the internet (requires `TAILOR_MCP_TOKEN`)

2. **Set a bearer token** if using `tailnet` or `public`:
   ```sh
   TAILOR_MCP_TOKEN="your-secure-random-token"
   ```

3. **Restart Tailor** to pick up the changes.

4. **Find your MCP URL**:
   - Local: `http://localhost:8080/mcp`
   - Tailnet: `https://tailor.<your-tailnet>.ts.net/mcp` (when using embedded `tsnet` mode)
   - Custom: `http(s)://<your-host>:8080/mcp`

5. **Connect your agent**. Most MCP-compatible clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) accept an HTTP SSE endpoint:
   - URL: your MCP URL from step 4
   - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <your-token>` (if required)

6. **Verify it's working** by asking the agent to describe your tailnet topology.

### Workflow

1. **Enable** — Set `TAILOR_MCP` to `localhost`, `tailnet`, or `public` (see Configuration below).
2. **Connect** — Point your agent at `http(s)://tailor.<your-tailnet>.ts.net/mcp` (or `http://localhost:8080/mcp`).
3. **Explore** — The agent reads your topology and policy.
4. **Draft** — The agent edits HuJSON with embedded ACL reference guidance.
5. **Evaluate** — The agent previews the impact on your graph.
6. **Stage** — The agent submits the draft to Tailor.
7. **Review** — Open the Tailor UI, inspect the staged draft, and save or discard it.

**Note:** You will notice that the agent cannot save to Tailscale directly, this is very intentional. 

### Security

| Setting | Exposure | Recommended Token |
|---|---|---|
| `localhost` | Only `127.0.0.1` / `::1` | None required |
| `tailnet` | Any tailnet client | Recommended |
| `public` | Internet-facing | Required |

Set `TAILOR_MCP_READONLY=true` to prevent agents from staging drafts — useful for observability-only setups.

**Reverse proxies:** `localhost` mode only allows connections from the same machine. If Tailor sits behind a reverse proxy or load balancer, the proxy appears as a remote client and requests will be rejected. In that case, use `tailnet` or `public` with a bearer token instead.

## Development

```sh
# Build and run the Go backend in dev mode (synthetic fleet)
pnpm --dir web dev:stack

# In another terminal, run the Vite dev server
pnpm --dir web dev:proxy
```

Dev mode compiles the backend with a built-in synthetic tailnet — a fake fleet of devices and a sample ACL policy — so you can work on the UI without joining a real tailnet. Use the demo API key `tskey-api-tailor-dev` to enable "Cloud API" editing against this synthetic data.

Run tests:
```sh
pnpm --dir web lint && pnpm --dir web check && pnpm --dir web test
pnpm --dir web test:e2e   # demo tailnet (see web/e2e/README.md)
go test ./... && go test -tags dev ./...
```

## PR oddities?
Ok, this is me trying something out. I [no longer](https://mrshu.github.io/github-statuses/) [trust](https://youtu.be/R7ex-Gt8dtw) [Github](https://dev.to/varshithvhegde/github-broke-git-the-merge-queue-bug-that-silently-deleted-your-code-4f7i). So I am using this repository to learn how to manage code both on and off Github. Feel free to open issues, or a PR! I will happily make it work. But that is why all my PRs are closed without being merged, they are being merged in my personal Forgejo instance.
